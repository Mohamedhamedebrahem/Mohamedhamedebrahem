Data-Analytics-Projects:
Certificate : https://graduation.udacity.com/nd002-mena-nfp2
This repository is mainly for projects I have done under Udacity-Data-Analysis-Nanodegree.

Udacity online data analyst program prepares me for a career as a data analyst by helping me learn to clean and organize data, uncover patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions, and clearly communicate critical findings. I am developing proficiency in Python and its data analysis libraries (Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib) and SQL as I build a portfolio of projects .

Tips: For data science projects with python, I would recomend you to install numpy , pandas , scipy , scikit learn , matplotlib , seaborn thest basic libraries.

Part 1 - Intro to Data Analysis
Subjects Covered:

Anaconda: Learn to use Anaconda to manage packages and environments for use with Python
Jupyter Notebook: Learn to use this open-source web application
Data Analysis Process
NumPy for 1 and 2D Data
Pandas Series and Dataframes
Project 1: Investigate a dataset called TMDb movie data.
I was provided a dataset reflecting data collected from an experiment. I used statistical techniques to answer questions about the data and report my conclusions and recommendations in a report. In this project, I choose one of Udacity's curated datasets and investigate it using NumPy and pandas.I complete the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing the findings.

Project 2: Data Analysis with No-show Movie appointments
Project 3: Data Analysis with-ncis-and-census-data
Part 2 -Practical Statistics
Subjects Covered:

Probability
Conditional Probability
Binominal Distribution
Sampling Distribution and Central Limit Theorem
Descriptive Statistics
Inferential Statistics
Confidence Levels and Intervals
Hypothesis Testing
T-tests and A/B test
Regression
Multiple Linear Regression
Logistic Regression
Project 4: Analyze A/B Test Results with company ab_data.csv
Using Python, I gathered data from a variety of sources, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it.I documented the wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python and SQL.By using AB Testing and regression methods to decide if the company should launch a new webpage or keep the old one.

Part 3 - Data Extraction and Wrangling
Subjects Covered:

GATHERING DATA:
Gather data from multiple sources, including gathering files, programmatically downloading files, web-scraping data, and accessing data from APIs
Import data of various file formats into pandas, including flat files (e.g. TSV), HTML files, TXT files, and JSON files
Store gathered data in a PostgreSQL database
ASSESSING DATA
Assess data visually and programmatically using pandas
Distinguish between dirty data (content or “quality” issues) and messy data (structural or “tidiness” issues)
Identify data quality issues and categorize them using metrics: validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency, and uniformity
CLEANING DATA
Identify each step of the data cleaning process (defining, coding,and testing)
Clean data using Python and pandas
Test cleaning code visually and programmatically using Python
Project 5 : Case Study in Data Wrangling.
I divide this project in three parts such as Gathering Data, Assessing Data, Cleaning Data. Dataset which i used in this project is really very messy. So first figure out what are the problem with dataset after that i found that the dataset have three major problem. First it has missing value, second is its Untidy dataset and third is quality issues. I clean this data step by step. In the end i am able to remove all problem associated with the data set. Now i have clean data. I perform all the cleaning operation in jupyter notebook using pandas and numpy.

Project 6 : Data Wrangle and Analyze with Tweet WeRateDogs data
Collect data from different sources and assess data visually and programmatically , clean data for visulizing data and finding insights later.

Part 4 - Data Visualization
Subjects Covered:

Univariate exploration of data ( histogram , bar charts , Use axis limits and different scales )
Bivariate exploration of data ( scatter plots , clustered bar charts , violin and bar charts , faceting )
Multivariate exploration of data ( encodings , plot matrices , feature enginnering )
Explanatory Visulizations ( story telling with data , polish plots , create slide deck )
Project 7: Data Visulization with Diamond Data
Data visualization to a dataset involving the characteristics of diamonds and their prices.

Project 8: Data Visualization with Communicate data finding with Ford Go Bike Sharing Data
In this project, I used Python’s data visualization tools to systematically explore the bike dataset for its properties and relationships between variables. Then, I created a presentation that communicates the findings to others.

Project 9: Data Visualization with Prosper Loan data.
